# yolo_bbox2seg
Converts a YOLO format bounding box dataset to a segmentation version using Meta's SAM (Segment Anything Network). This is a modification of the automatic annotation feature provided by ultralytics, but instead uses a pre-existing dataset to generate the masks instead of using trained weights. 
Tested with a dataset to be trained with yolov8.

## Installation
This requires the ultralytics pip package, so you can just follow the installation instructions from the [Ultralytics Repository](https://www.example.com](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
